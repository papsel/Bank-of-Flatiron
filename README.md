# Bank of Flatiron

This react app is called the Bank of Flatiron, where you can trust us with all your financial
data!
For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a
list of your recent bank transactions, among other features.
This react app should meet the following
As a user, I can:

See a table of all transactions.
 Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table *the new transaction does not have to be persisted to the backend*
Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.

### Requirements
1. Have a stable internet
2. Be in possession of a computer


### Deployment
1. Run `npm install` in your terminal.
2. Run `npm run server`. This will run your backend on port `3000`.
3. In a new terminal, run `npm start`. This will run your React app on port `3001`.

Make sure to open
[http://localhost:3000/transactions](http://localhost:3000/transactions) in the
browser to verify that your backend is working before you proceed!
